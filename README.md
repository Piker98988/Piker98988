## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Iker. I'm an Spanish stududent. I'm 16 years old and I like to develop UIs. 
# Languages
## Programming
- ### Python  +80h 
- ### Kotlin  <20h
- ### C# MAUI <10h
## Little yap about my story (not so little)
When I started learning, I started with Python and almost completed a >100h course before my files on it were deleted. Nice.
After that happened, I started to use GitHub but quickly fell off. Then, I found about _codewars.com_, a site in which challenges are proposed and 
you have to solve them, so that's basically what I did for a year until I found out about android app development with Kotlin and Android Studio.
At first, I tried to learn Java to know about Kotlin but quickly wanted to rip my skin off because of the language. Then, I thought: 
"Why shouldn't I start using Kotlin directly?" and that's exactly what I did. With Android Studio I used Jetpack Compose and also wanted to rip my
skin, so I knew I had to transition to another thing quickly. After all of that happened, I decided I would just practice Python on _codewars.com_ to
countinue honing my skills. Next on the story was the OIM, for those who don't know, the *Olimpiada InformÃ¡tica de Madrid* and for those who still don't
know, the *Madrid's computing olympics*, which for those who still don't know, it was basically just a competition of programming. In this competition, you 
could use whatever language you wanted, which I still think to this day why did they think it was a good idea. I finished first place of Python programmers. Which 
was 17th place of the entire competition. Pretty neat, right? Well, right now I'm working on my C# MAUI skills to try and become better at UI design, which is
my ultimate goal.
